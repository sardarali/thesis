DEDICATION
\end{center}

\begin{center}
To my parents \textit{Subhania} and \textit{Abdulkabir} for their sacrifices, prayers, and support; wife \textit{Najma Bibi} for convencing her parents to marry a PhD student; and our little princess \textit{Manhaa}, who just arrived in the final phase of this writing to give it a final push.
\end{center}
