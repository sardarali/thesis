educational career. They have always supported and encouraged me to do my best in all
matters of life.

My wife \textit{Najma}, for dedicating every moment to my happiness and prioritizing my dreams. Her unending love, delicious food, and
extended support in the last year of my PhD contributed to the realization of this work.

My heartfelt thanks to my committee members \textit{Dr. Dimitri Marinakis}, and \textit{Dr. Hong-Chuan Yang}, project fellow \textit{Kyle Weston}; and all

all the assistance provided by \textit{Dr. Kui Wu} and others, I alone
