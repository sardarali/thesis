For privacy and security reasons, the physical network structure/diagram is omitted. Instead, we represent the topology/positions of the installed power quality meters via a graph network as shown in Fig. 3.2. There are a total of $10$ power quality meters (numbered from $m_1$ to $m_{10}$) installed. Each meter reported the power quality events (sag/swell, transient, etc.) to the data collection server via Ethernet network. It is important to mention that we currently do not consider power transmission network, which is large-scale and may involve multiple utilities across a country, but only focus on power distribution network at the enterprise-level, e.g., university campus. Hence, we collect the power quality dataset at an enterprise network located at the distribution level. The network is using a standard three-phase distribution system. Devices of varying loads are using this network, including electric vehicles and large motors. Three-phase transformers with four-wire output are used for $120$ volt service. Table 3.1 shows the number of events reported by each power quality meter while the positions of the meters are shown in Fig. 3.2.}

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Response:}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
I agree with the fact that the frequency of the PQ class $c_{14}$ for all meters is reported as 0 (in Table 3.2) while the same for a single meter (device $d_8$ in Table 3.6) is reported as $2122$. The reason is as follows.

\vspace{5pt}\noindent The power quality classes from $c_1$ to $c_{13}$ represent the power disturbances (described in Table 3.4) while $c_{14}$ represents the nominal power quality (a good/normal power quality). The power quality meters in our data collection network were configured to report only bad power quality events and hence the frequency of PQ class $c_{14}$) is 0 in table 3.2. We also noticed that, in some cases, there are bad power quality events reported at some links while nothing reported by other meters at that time instance. This happens when a device, for instance a UPS, maps a bad quality to good quality. In such cases, we assume a nominal PQ value (PQ class $c_{14}$) at the monitored but unreported points.

\vspace{5pt}\noindent The same explanation is now added in Chapter 3. The revised explanation from the thesis is as follows.

\vspace{5pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{Using IEEE Standard 1159 [2], we classify the power quality events based on the fluctuation of the voltage for a predefined period. There are $14$ different power quality classes defined in the standard, denoted from $c_1$ to $c_{14}$, respectively. Table 3.5 shows samples of the events we classify using the IEEE standard where the power quality class is shown in the last column of the table. The frequency of events belonging to the IEEE power quality class ($c_1$ to $c_{14}$) is shown in Table 3.2. Description of the IEEE power quality classes is provided in Table 3.4.}

\end{adjustwidth}

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Response:}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
I have adding new discussion on the importance of the time saving. The updated discussion from the thesis is as follows.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{Table 6.2 shows the convergence time comparison of both the EM and MaxEnt based solutions to power quality estimation. It can be seen that the convergence time of MaxEnt is much faster as compared to that of EM algorithm. The convergence time is exponentially increasing for the EM algorithm with the network size. For a real-time estimation, the convergence time is more important and the EM based solution is not feasible to operate in real-time given its huge convergence delays. We measure the estimation accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which is a statistical measure quantifying the difference between values implied by an estimator and the true values of the quantity being estimated. The results are shown in Table 6.3. From the results, we can see that both the methods give very close estimations of the power quality transition functions, i.e., the difference between the estimated and corresponding ground truth functions is negligible.}

\textcolor{red}{Is there a reverse transfer function?}
\end{adjustwidth}

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Response:}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
Yes, in order to calculate the impact of a child node on its parent, we use the reverse transfer function. This concept is explained in greater details in the thesis and quoted as follows.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{The problem is inherently challenging as the information received from a power meter flows not only the forward direction from the root nodes toward the leaf nodes, but also in reverse or upstream direction toward the root node (utility main) and back to all other nodes in the network.}

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{
We calculate the influence of a child device on a parent device. Note that the parent may not necessarily be the immediate parent. To calculate the entropy of parent given child using the general formula of conditional entropy, we need to first calculate the conditional transition function $F$.}

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{We use the concept of posterior probability (the Bayes theorem) to calculate F. This function is simply the product of the reverse transition functions of devices all the way from child to parent. The reverse transition function $f^\prime(d)$ (consist of $p(parent \mid child)$ or $p(X \mid Y)$) is calculated as $p(X \mid Y) = \frac{p(X) p(Y/X)}{ p(Y)}$.  In our case, the function $f^\prime(d)$ of a device $d$ which list $p(x \mid y)$ in the $xth$ row and $yth$ column is calculated as:
\[f^\prime(d) = \left[\begin{array}{c} f_x(\widehat d)\\ f_x(\widehat d)\\ \vdots\\ f_x(\widehat d) \end{array}\right] \otimes \left[f(d)\right]^T \oslash \left[\begin{array}{c} f_x(d)\\ f_x(d)\\ \vdots\\ f_x(d) \end{array}\right]^T,\]
\noindent where $\otimes$ is the component-wise product, $\oslash$ is the component-wise division, and $\widehat d$ is the immediate parent of device $d$.
Finally:
%\vspace{-0.05in}
\[F = f^\prime(d_o) \times f^\prime(\widehat {d_o}) \times \hdots \times f^\prime(\widecheck {d_i}).\]}

In Chapter 3, using a real-time PQ dataset, we learned the device latent feature (transfer function). The $k$-fold validation proved that the transfer functions were consistent over time. The same is explained in Chapter 3 and quoted below.

\noindent\textcolor{blue}{In this chapter, we proposed a device latent feature model which learns a device transfer function from real data. The device transfer function is needed to estimate the power quality values on unmonitored links in the power gird. In order to validate the proposed model, We used a real power quality dataset collected by Schneider Electric Inc. in a power grid in Canada. We demonstrated that the historical data can be used to capture the latent features of a device. The $k$-fold cross-validation technique was used to measure the accuracy of latent features we obtained using our dataset. \textbf{Experimental evaluations showed that the captured latent features are consistent}. The latent features learnt in this chapter are used by our meter placement algorithms proposed in Chapter 5.}

\end{adjustwidth}

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Response:}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
In MaxEnt solution, we divide the power network in sub-networks based on meter positions. Since the input and output links of each subnet are monitored, the network topology outside the subnet has no impact on the MaxEnt solution. For larger subnets, the size of unknown variables increases exponentially. Hence, for subnets of larger sizes, the MaxEnt will take longer to converge. We have discussed this potential problem and a possible solution in our thesis.

\vspace{10pt}
\noindent\textcolor{blue}{The proposed solution may not converge efficiently for sub-nets of larger sizes. The scalability problem arises as the number of unknown variables increases exponentially with the increase in the number of components in a subnet. The idea for the extended work is to divide the larger subnets in logical components where each logical component will represent several physical components. Instead of computing individual transfer functions for each physical device, transfer functions of the logical components could be estimated first. In the second round, transfer functions of individual physical components could be estimated from the logical transfer functions. Note that this is a high level guideline which only serves as a starting point towards the final solution. The final solution could be based on a comprehensive mathematical model. Finally, for the evaluation of such a system, various larger IEEE standard test networks could be used.}
