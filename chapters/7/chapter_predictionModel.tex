\section{Motivation}
As discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter:introduction}, the main objective of this work is to increase the reliability of power networks within given budget in terms of power quality. In order to monitor the power quality, power quality meters are being deployed. Since power quality meters are expensive devices, we (in chapter~\ref{chap:PQEstimation}) proposed MaxEnt based algorithm for power quality estimation on unmonitored network segments in power network. For meter deployments, we proposed conditional entropy based algorithms (in chapter~{chap:meterPlacement}) that intelligently place meters on selected network segments so that the power quality could be inferred as accurately as possible.

Since the power quality readings (exact readings from monitored links, estimated reading from unmonitored links) are available now, we use this information to estimate the state of the network and identify any potential malfunctioning device. The research objective is to address the problem: \textit{how to detect a potential malfunctioning device in the power network based on available power quality readings}. In the next section, we propose an algorithm that helps to detect the malfunctioning devices in the power network.

\section{The Model}

\section{Evaluations}
Assume that one or more smart meters have continuously measured poor power quality. The power quality is indicated by some specific power quality index, for instance the System Average RMS Variation Frequency (SARFI) index . Based on the measured and estimated PQ values, we would like to know which device is most likely to be malfunctioning. Here, we assume that we know the transform function of each device if the device is working properly. We call these transfer functions the regular transform functions of the devices. Now, a malfunctioning device is the one whose estimated transform function deviates significantly from its regular transform function.

We plan to first give a comprehensive mathematical model of the problem. We then device a mechanism to calculate the deviation in transfer functions and finally we plan to propose an algorithm to efficiently identify any potential malfunctioning device in the power network. The proposed algorithm will be evaluated on various tree and bus structured network; specifically we will use the IEEE standard test networks for our simulations.

\section{Conclusion}
Power quality meters play an important role in the reliability of power networks. We plan to investigate the problem of identifying devices that degrade the power quality in the system. The proposed solution will be built on top of our already proposed work.
